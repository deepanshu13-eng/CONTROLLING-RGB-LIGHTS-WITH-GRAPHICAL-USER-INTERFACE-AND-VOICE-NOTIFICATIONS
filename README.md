# CONTROLLING-RGB-LIGHTS-WITH-GRAPHICAL-USER-INTERFACE-AND-VOICE-NOTIFICATIONS
In this project we will learn how we can create a graphical user interface with the help of python and how we can control our rgb led's with the help of arduino and python with voice notifications.  
Arduino and python will communicate with each other with the help of pyserial library.
Creating a graphical user interface will help us to control all our appliances from our pc or laptop.
pyttsx3 library will help in giving voice notifications when we turn on/off any light.
